The implementation of rule-based tutoring system.
It implements:
1. The control mechansim known as the inference engine.
2. Forward chaining deduction.
3. Use of first order logic as the input from the user.
4. Graphical user interface.
Based on all of those elements a functioning and read for enhancment tutoring system has
been developed to challenge the currect problems of software of this type.
These problems include:
1. Service related effort such as creating of an account.
2. Need for internet connection
3. Limited data used for questions.
4. Similarity between those systems.
5. No results at the end of the system to lure user into some action. 
6. Being created at some expected level of education.

The result is a non-deterministic system which at the moment allows a practice of Algorithm by showing a 35 distinct questions
that can be repeated as many time as necessary. A feedback is given in form of a score and the treestructure of the user's 
achievement.
